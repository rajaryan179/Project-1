# Project-1

This smart contract allows users to deposit ETH and receive 50% of its value in nUSD tokens. The deposit function calculates the amount of nUSD to be minted based on the received ETH and the current ETH price obtained from the Chainlink Oracle. The nUSD tokens are minted, and the total supply is updated accordingly.
